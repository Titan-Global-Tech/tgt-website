# Isormphic Web App Template

Starting website template for the organization's website that uses server side rendering coupled with a responsive web app written in React. It is derived from [b1tn3r/fuller-stack-starter-app](https://github.com/b1tn3r/fuller-stack-starter-app), but without all the extra options for starting an app. In this template, I have chosen a specific UI library and certain features to add, but the core features of using React, Redux, and React-Redux-Router are still the same.
